# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->
This system focuses on a corpus involving 14 travel guides about a region with 9 different towns,
along with general guides on accessibility, eating, regional transportation, seasons, and walking. The system
answers questions about the towns in this region, such as where to eat, when do buses run, which locations may
have cheaper accomodations, etc.

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** 1000
**Overlap:** 120

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

I picked these numbers because each guide is formatted with a title and distinct sections, marked with a "#" 
and a "##" respecitively. Additionally, each section has a maximum of 1000 characters in it, including their
section headers. This gave me the idea for the chunk size and to fashion the chunks after the sections. I
initially was going to label chunks just by their headers before I recognized that many of the guides have
identical header names, making it difficult to determine which guide a section was coming from. To compensate
for this, I also added the title at the top of each document to the chunk labels.

Using this method, I generated more, smaller chunks. But I could also guarantee that all these chunks included
relevant information grouped together and I could tell where they were sourced from. Additionally, these chunks
no longer included sentences or paragraphs that were cut off in the middle or too short.

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: `guide_accessibility.md#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Getting around the region with limited mobility, Intro

An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are
difficult and it is better to know in advance.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `guide_corry_vale.md#6` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Corry Vale, When to go

May to September. Outside those months the pub in the third village closes, the farm shop reduces its hours, and several footpaths become genuinely boggy rather than merely wet. The road is not gritted above the second village and is impassable in snow.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `guide_givens_mill.md#3` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Givens Mill, Eat and drink

A tearoom attached to the mill, open 10 to 4 daily except Tuesdays, which sells bread made from the flour ground twenty metres away and is the reason most people come. One pub, food served lunchtimes and Thursday to Saturday evenings.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `guide_kestrelford.md#6` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Kestrelford, When to go

Late spring and early autumn. The Saturday market runs year-round but is much reduced from November to February. August is busy with walkers. The single-track approach road is genuinely difficult in snow and the town can be cut off for a day or two most winters.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `guide_regional_transport.md#1` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Getting around the region, The railway

The line runs along the river valley, connecting Brightwater to the regional
hub in 50 minutes. Eleven services a day on weekdays, six on Sundays. The line
north of Brightwater closed in 1963 and everything beyond it is bus or car.

Tickets are cheaper booked the day before than on the day, and considerably
cheaper than that booked a week ahead. There is no ticket office at
Brightwater station outside weekday mornings; the machine on the platform takes
cards only.

```

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:**
In what year did the pier in Pellew Sands catch on fire?

**Answer:**

```
(best distance 0.194, cutoff 0.6)

The pier in Pellew Sands was partly destroyed by fire in 1978 (guide_pellew_sands.md).

Sources retrieved: guide_pellew_sands.md
```

**My relevance cutoff:**

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| How many shops does Elder Ness have? | Yes | 0.3657 |
| How often do buses run in Halden Bay in a day? | Yes | 0.2891 |
| In what year did the pier in Pellew Sands catch on fire? | Yes | 0.1944 |
| Does Brightwater or Corry Vale have cheaper accommodations? | Yes | 0.2557 |
| Which places are busiest in October? | Yes | 0.4777 |
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | No | 0.7850 |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | No | 0.8834 |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | No | 0.9351 |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | No | 0.8482 |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | No | 0.8419 |

Looking at these two groups of questions, the corpus question distances range between 0.19-0.47 while the
non-corpus questions range between 0.78-0.93. Seeing this, I decided to put my relevance cutoff 0.65.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
